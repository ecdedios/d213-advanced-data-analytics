# Task 2 - Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks

> Throughout your career as a data analyst, you will assess continuing data sources for their relevance to specific research questions. Organizations use data sets to analyze their operations. Organizations may use these data sets in many ways to support their decision-making processes.

> In your previous work, you explored a variety of supervised and unsupervised data mining models. You have seen the power of using data analysis techniques to help organizations make data-driven decisions, and you will now extend these models into areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this course, you will explore the use of neural networks and natural language processing (NLP).

> In this task, you will use the “UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences Data Set” in the Web Links section. You will build a neural network that is designed to learn word usage and context using NLP techniques. You will provide visualizations and a report, as well as build your network in an interactive development environment.
