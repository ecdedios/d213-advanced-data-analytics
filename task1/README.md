# Task 1 - Time-Series Modeling

> As a data analyst, you will assess continuing data sources for their relevance to specific research questions throughout your career.

> In your previous coursework, you performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on your data. You have seen basic trends and will now build more sophisticated statistical models.

> After you choose your organizational data set, you will review the data dictionary and considerations related to the raw data file you have chosen and prepare the data for time series modeling. You will then analyze that data set using time series modeling, create visualizations, generate forecasts, and deliver the results of your analysis.
